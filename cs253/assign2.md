# CS 253 - Assignment 2: Oh What a Tangled Web We Weave
## Felipe Meneses
### Code Injection

1.  You and a friend built a site that accepts and displays user-generated content. You recently read  [the XKCD comic about code injection](https://xkcd.com/327/)  which made you realize that you're not sanitizing user-submitted data anywhere in your web app. You realize that you're almost certainly vulnerable to Cross site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection attacks â€“ yikes!
    
    Rereading the comic, you notice it ends with the phrase "I hope you've learned to sanitize your database inputs". Your friend suggests solving the issue by escaping all user-submitted data  _before_  inserting it into the database. Your friend argues that by sanitizing the  _inputs_  to the database as the comic suggests, the data can then be extracted from the database and safely used in HTML and SQL without further escaping.
    
    Is this a valid argument? (Yes/No) Why or why not?
    
	No. Indeed, sanitizing the inputs on the way in seems appealing, for we would only need to sanitize the inputs once. Conversely, we don't know in which context this data is going to be used (in html, script, etc.) so it is always good to assume the inputs have not been sanitized and sanitize them on the way out because we do know the context then. 

    
2.  You and a friend decide to build an internal dashboard that will show real-time HTTP requests that are being sent by visitors to your site. The dashboard displays information about each HTTP request received by the web server, including the client's IP address, HTTP method, URL, query parameters, referrer URL, and user agent name.
    
    Incidentally, this is the exact set of information that most popular web servers like Nginx or Apache print into the server log files. Here is what one line from such a log file looks like:
    
    ```yml
    12.34.56.78 - - [17/Oct/2019:05:01:59 +0000] "GET /api/midi/search?q=hi&page=0 HTTP/1.0" 200 178 "https://example.com/search?q=h" "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/77.0.3865.90 Safari/537.36"
    ```
    
    The internal dashboard will only be used by you and your friend and will not be exposed to the broader internet since the logs reveal information about your site visitors. Your friend argues that there is no need to worry about XSS vulnerabilites in an internal-only dashboard since neither of you would create an XSS attack to use against the other. Given that, they see no way that an XSS attack could occur.
    
    Is this a valid argument? (Yes/No) Why or why not?
    
    No, if the inputs are left unsanitized then an attacker could send a malicious HTTP request. For instance, it could use the query parameter in the URL to perform XSS and send the user data to a malicious server.
    
3.  Name a real-world case where adherence to the Robustness principle (a.k.a. Postel's law) caused a system to have worse security. Explain how the Robustness principle led to the system having worse security properties.

	The browser's HTML interpreter follows the Robustness principle and it is really forgiving (`<script>` is the same as `<sCRIpt>`). One of the issues with this is that it augments the sample space for XSS attacks, which leads to a system having worse security properties. 
    

### Same Origin Policy

4.  Name three ways that the Same Origin Policy protects a website.

	   It prevents site A to embed site B and modify its contents. It is also used to prevent cross-site request forgery. Finally, it prevents site A to read data from site B.
   
5.  Can JavaScript code running on  **attacker.com**  cause a GET request to be sent to  **victim.com**? (Yes/No)

    Yes, if **atacker.com** embeds an image whose source is a link to **victim.com**, the browser will perform a GET request to get the image.
7.  Can JavaScript code running on  **attacker.com**  use the  `fetch()`  API to send a GET request to  **victim.com**  and read the HTTP response body? (Yes/No)
    
    Assume no CORS headers are present on the response.
    No.
8.  Can JavaScript code running on  **attacker.com**  submit a form via a POST request to  **victim.com**? (Yes/No)
    No.
9.  A fascinating Same origin policy "bypass" was described in  ["Cross-Origin JavaScript Capability Leaks: Detection, Exploitation, and Defense"](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity09/technical-sessions/presentation/cross-origin-javascript-capability-leaks), a talk at USENIX '09 (one of the top security conferences). How could an attacker use this browser implementation bug to bypass the same origin policy? What was the key reason for the bug? What was the proposed mitigation? Please keep your answer to 200 words or fewer. 
 The root of the bug is that we have two security policy going on (DOM and JS Engine). What this means is given a global object, and two contexts inside it, Context 1 could get a hold of a reference of Context 2 through the JS Engine when the browser leaks a JavaScript pointer from one security origin to another. The key reason for the bug is described in the paper in the following excerpt:

	> The DOM contains pointers to JavaScript objects in multiple security
	> origins and developers can easily select the wrong pointer to disclose
	> to a script

	They call this cross-origin JavaScript capabilities leaks, and they propose to mitigate it by adding access control checks to browser JavaScript engines.

### Content Security Policy

Content Security Policy (CSP) is one of the best ways to protect your site against XSS. A properly written CSP can  **completely**  protect your site from reflected and stored XSS attacks, even in the presence of a bug that allows the attacker to add their own HTML code to the site.

For all questions, you should assume the user agent is a modern browser that supports the latest Content Security Policy specification,  [CSP Level 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/).

You may find these resources useful:

-   [MDN: Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)
-   [MDN:  `Content-Security-Policy`  header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy)

9.  An attacker takes advantage of a vulnerability in your site to inject an XSS payload into the HTML page sent by your server. Fortunately, you set up a CSP in case this happened because you follow a defense-in-depth security approach. 
Would the following CSP prevent the XSS attack? (Yes/No)
  
    Why or why not?
    ```http
    Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self';
    ```
    
    ```html
    <script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
    ```
    Yes, because inline scripts are prevented.
    
1.  Would the following CSP prevent the XSS attack? (Yes/No)
    
    Why or why not?
    ```http
    Content-Security-Policy: default-src *; script-src 'self';
    ```
    
    ```html
    <script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
    ```
    Yes, this behaves the same way as the previous example since `default-src *;` is just a fallback.
1.  Would the following CSP prevent the XSS attack? (Yes/No)
    
    Why or why not?
    
    ```http
    Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval'; connect-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; style-src 'self';
    ```
    
    ```html
    <script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
    ```
    Yes, even though we now have the `'unsafe-eval'` tag, this is still an inline script.
    
1.  Would the following CSP prevent the XSS attack? (Yes/No)
    
    Why or why not?
    
    ```http
    Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval'; connect-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; style-src 'self';
    ```
    
    ```html
    <script>eval('alert(document.cookie)')</script>
    ```
    Yes, even though we have the `'unsafe-eval'` tag and an `eval` statement in the `<script>` tag, this is still an inline script which is not allowed.
1.  Would the following CSP prevent the XSS attack? (Yes/No)
    
    Why or why not?
    ```http
    Content-Security-Policy: default-src *; script-src 'self'; connect-src *; img-src *; style-src *;
    ```
    
    ```html
    <script src='https://attacker.com/xss.js'></script>
    ```
    Yes, because the script does not come from the victim's website.
1.  Would the following CSP prevent the XSS attack? (Yes/No)
    
    Why or why not?
    
    ```http
    Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; script-src 'self' https:; connect-src 'none'; img-src 'none'; style-src 'none';
    ```
    
    ```html
    <script src='https://attacker.com/xss.js'></script>
    ```
    No, because now the policy allows any script from https to be run.
1.  Would the following CSP prevent the XSS attack? (Yes/No)
    
    Why or why not?
    
    ```http
    Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' 'nonce-R28gU3RhbmZvcmQh';
    ```
    
    ```html
    <script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
    ```
    Yes, because the script lacks a nonce that shows that it is trusted.
1.  Would the following CSP prevent the XSS attack? (Yes/No)
    
    Why or why not?
    
    ```http
    Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' 'nonce-R28gU3RhbmZvcmQh';
    ```
    
    ```html
    <script nonce='xss'>alert(document.cookie)</script>
    ```
    Yes, because the nonce does not match and hence we know it came from an attacker.
1.  Would the following CSP prevent the XSS attack? (Yes/No)
    
    Why or why not?
    
    ```http
    Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' 'nonce-R28gU3RhbmZvcmQh' 'unsafe-inline';
    ```
    
    ```html
    <script nonce='xss'>alert(document.cookie)</script>
    ```
    Yes, because the nonce specified does not match the nonce in the CSP.
1.  Would the following CSP prevent the XSS attack? (Yes/No)
    
    Why or why not?
    
    ```http
    Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self';
    ```
    
    ```html
    <script src='/api/echo?str=alert(document.cookie)'></script>
    ```
    Where  `/api/echo`  is a working API endpoint on the victim webserver that replies back with whatever string it receives in the  `str`  query parameter. For example, the URL  `/api/echo?str=hello`  returns an HTTP response with a body of  `hello`.
    
    In case it makes a difference, you can assume the API response has a  `Content-Type`  header with a value of  `text/plain`.
    
    No, because the source of the script indeed comes from the victim's website.
2.  Assume that  **victim.com**  is protected with the following CSP:

    ```http
    Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' 'nonce-<nonce-value-here>';
    ```
    
    The operator of  **attacker.com**  attempts to subvert  **victim.com**'s CSP by visitng  **victim.com**  and copying the nonce they observe in the CSP header into their XSS attack payload:
    
    ```html
    <script nonce='<nonce-value-here>'>alert(document.cookie)</script>
    ```
    
    Would the CSP prevent the XSS attack? (Yes/No) Why or why not?
    
    (Assume that  **victim.com**  has properly implemented their CSP nonces.)
    
    No, because inline scripts with the nonce are allowed in this policy.
21.  Read the paper  ["CSP Is Dead, Long Live CSP! On the Insecurity of Whitelists and the Future of Content Security Policy"](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub45542). Explain the problem that  `'strict-dynamic'`  keyword solves.
    
   As written in the paper:
    
> "With 'strict-dynamicâ€™, dynamically generated scripts implicitly
> inherit the nonce from the trusted script that created them. This way,
> alreadyexecuting, legitimate scripts can easily add new scripts to the
> DOM without extensive application changes. However, an attacker who
> finds an XSS bug, not knowing the correct nonce, is not able to abuse
> this functionality because they are prevented from executing scripts
> in the first place."
